<h1 class="tracking-widest font-mono">about me.</h1>

Hi there 👋!  
I am **Shankha Suvra Dam**. I welcome you to my personal website, built with love using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Glad to have you here!  

> *Who are you?*  

I am a student of mathematics, who also likes to dabble in a little bit of everything! If you're interested in my CV, it's right [___here___](#curriculum-vitae)

My **favourite theorem** is the **Aziz-Mackenzie Theorem** (Link to [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-free_cake-cutting#Short_history) on *Envy-free Cake-Cutting*).

<Callout type="info" title="Aziz-Mackenzie Theorem" collapsible collapsed>
    Proven in $2016$, by `Haris Aziz` and `Simon Mackenzie`, this theorem says that:
    > There exists an [envy-free cake-cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-free_cake-cutting) protocol with a bounded number of steps for any number of people.

    The reason I find this very interesting is because, firstly, this had been unsolved for decades! And the number of steps, while bounded, is still absolutely mind-bogglingly humongous.

    They basically presented a discrete envy-free protocol that requires at most $n^{n^{n^{n^{n^n}}}}$ (or more nicely, $n\uparrow\uparrow 6$) many queries.

    This is just a great example of things escaping intuition just due to sheer numbers, and while this protocol isn't useful at the slightest in practice, I find it to be my favourite owing to this depiction and its theoretical significance.

## Interests

### Academic

My current academic interests are rather volatile, however they primarily lie in (no particular order):

- Theoretical Computer Science
- Graph Theory, Combinatorics
- Statistical Mechanics
- Computational Biology
- Mathematical Morphology
- Dynamical Systems

### Hobbies

My hobbies are various in number as well, some of the most major ones being:

- **Chess**
    - **FIDE Rated** $1635$ in Blitz; $1535$ in Rapid
    - Represented **ISI Bengaluru Centre** twice in **Indian College Chess Championship** (2024, 2025 Fall [Came **$2^{\text{nd}}$**])
- **Speedcubing**
    - **Main Events:** $2\times 2$, $3\times 3$, Pyraminx, Megaminx
    - I also enjoy $3\times 3$ FMC, $4\times 4$ and $5\times 5$, but I never got decent enough at it 😔
- **Coding**
    - I enjoy building random ideas, and while I am indeed unable to finish many of them, it's certainly an enjoyable process?
    - Some of my coding projects can be found in the [`projects`](/projects) tab! Take a look!
- **Reading**
    - Be it a random intriguing research paper (there's a surprising few actually) or a book, as long as it catches my interest, I'm sure to go through it
    - If you've got something interesting to share, please do, I'm always down for new stuff!
