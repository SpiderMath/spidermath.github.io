title: Winter 2025 | Prof. B. S. Daya Sagar
description: During my fifth semester, I reached out to Prof. B. S. Daya Sagar, enquiring about an elective that he had taken during the academic year of 2015-16 on Mathematical Morphology. I ended up doing a project on the study of mathematical morphology towards the latter end of the semester, the winter break, and is still currently on-going.
