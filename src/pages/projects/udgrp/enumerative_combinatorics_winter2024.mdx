title: Winter 2024 | Enumerative Combinatorics UDGRP-W
description: UDGRP (Undergraduate Directed Reading Program) is a program of the Math Club, ISI Bengaluru Centre, where BMath (and sometimes MMath) students conduct group reading projects with fellow batchmates and juniors. During the Winter Break of 2024 (December 2024), I attended the UDGRP-W on Enumerative Combinatorics lead by Hrishik Koley, BMath Third Year.
