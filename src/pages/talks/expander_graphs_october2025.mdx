title: Introduction to Expander and Ramanujan Graphs
description: In my fifth semester, I gave a talk at Math Club, ISI Bengaluru Centre, introducing the concepts of expander graphs, along with the various definitions of expander graphs (combinatorial, spectral, probabilistic), and eventually ending at the definition of Ramanujan graphs, and utilising the same for Derandomisation of Randomised Algorithms.
