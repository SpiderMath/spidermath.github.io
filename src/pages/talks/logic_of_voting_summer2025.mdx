title: Logic of Voting: When Math Meets Democracy
description: During the Summer break of 2025 (May 2025 - July 2025), I gave a talk at LIMIT Camp (Category A) (an event organised by ISI Students and Research Scholars) on the topic of voting systems. I attempted to introduce the concepts involved when judging fairness of various voting systems, and eventually stating and introducing Arrow's Theorem.
